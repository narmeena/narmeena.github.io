    "title": "Is Coco Gauff the next GOAT of Women’s Tennis?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since Cori ‘Coco’ Gauff won her first professional match in May 2018 at the ripe age of 13, she has been the talk of the women’s tennis world. Gauff has career-high rankings of world No.3 in singles and of world No.1 in doubles by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA).\nImpressive isn’t even the word for a 19-year-old.\nShe’s constantly compared to her own role model, Serena Williams, the GOAT of women’s tennis. That says a lot. In 2023, at 19, she became the youngest woman to win the US Open since Serena Williams.\nSo why isn’t she ranked No.1?\nTo see if experience matters, here’s a look at rankings and how many matches the top 20-ranked players have played.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ntennis &lt;- read_csv(\"tennis.csv\")\n  \ntop20 &lt;- tennis |&gt; filter(Rank&lt;=20)\n\ncg &lt;- top20 |&gt; filter(Player == \"COCOGAUFF USA\")\nas &lt;- top20 |&gt; filter(Player == \"ARYNASABALENKA BLR\")\nis &lt;- top20 |&gt; filter(Player == \"IGASWIATEK POL\")\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=top20, aes(x=reorder(Player, Matches), weight= Matches), fill=\"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=cg, aes(x=reorder(Player, Matches), weight= Matches), fill=\"red\")  +\n  geom_bar(data=as, aes(x=reorder(Player, Matches), weight= Matches), fill=\"blue\")  +\n  geom_bar(data=is, aes(x=reorder(Player, Matches), weight= Matches), fill=\"green\")  +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Player\",\n    y= \"Matches\",\n    title = \"Does the Number of Matches Played Impact Tennis Standings?\",\n    subtitle = \"Sabalenka proves you don't have to have played hundreds of matches to be No.1.\",\n    caption = \"Source: WTAtennis.com | By Narmeena Ibrahimova\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this chart it shows Gauff has played 62 matches, while Iga Swiatek(2) has played 74 and Aryna Sabalenka(1) has played 65.\nIt’s clear that the number of matches these players have played doesn’t really have an effect on their ranking itself. Though, playing more matches puts their name and face out there, it doesn’t really have a big effect on their placement on the leaderboard.\nBut what about their actual performance on the court?\nPoints don’t start unless the serve goes in. Gauff has a killer serve. Watching her is like watching a mini Williams.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nab &lt;- c(\"Aces\"=388, \"DF\"=256)\nip &lt;- c(\"Aces\"=119, \"DF\"=116,409)\ncg &lt;- c(\"Aces\"=255, \"DF\"=188,201)\n\niron(\n  waffle(ab,\n        rows = 10, \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n     ) + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Sabalenka\")) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Unpacking the Impact of Aces and Double Faults on the Top 3\",\n    subtitle = \"Clearly, rankings go beyond the baseline.\",\n    color=\"Sabalenka\"\n  )  + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) ,\n  waffle(ip,\n        rows = 10, \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")\n         ) + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Swiatek\")),\n    waffle(cg,\n        rows = 10, \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 ace or double fault\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Gauff\")) +\nlabs(\n    caption = \"Source: WTAtennis.com | By Narmeena Ibrahimova\",\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s crucial to get the first serve in the service box.\nGauff has no problem doing that, and it’s clear Sabalenka doesn’t either.\nServes are important. A point can’t start without one. Coco does better at getting easy points with an ace than No.2 Swiatek, but not better than Sabalenka. But Sabalenka has a lot more double faults, which are errors, than both Gauff and Swiatek.\nMake it make sense.\n\n\nCode\nserve &lt;- tennis |&gt;\nfilter(Rank&lt;21)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=serve,\n    aes(y=Player, x=`1st Srv %`, xend= `2nd Srv %`),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Serve %\",\n    y=\"Player\",\n    title=\"The Crucial Mix of 1st Serve Precision and 2nd Serve Strategy\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:darkgreen;'&gt;serves&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good. If &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;serves&lt;/span&gt; are on the far left, that's not so good.\",\n    caption = \"Source: WTAtennis.com | By Narmeena Ibrahimova\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nCoco’s first serve percentage is pretty average. Though, all of the women in the top 20 have a decent serving percentage, when looking at both first and second serves.\nGauff clearly has the potential to be the next GOAT in women’s tennis. Only being 19 with this much experience already, her being No.1 could be reality in the very near future. When one watches Coco Gauff on the court, they’re immediately reminded of Serena Williams. But she’s here to be the best Coco. The future of Coco Gauff is bright, it’s almost blinding."

    "text": "Everyone knows who the star of men’s tennis is.\nNovak Djokovic.\nRight now it’s Djokovic vs. just about everyone else.\nBut there are three stars right behind him. In fact, they’re so close to passing him in stats but they struggle in one aspect. Daniil Medvedev, Jannik Sinner, and Carlos Alcaraz all seem to be the best competition for Djokovic right now.\nBut is that heir out there?\nFirst, let’s take a look at how they perform under pressure.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\npressure &lt;- read_csv(\"pressure.csv\")\nreturn &lt;- read_csv(\"return.csv\")\nserve &lt;-read_csv(\"serve.csv\")\n\ncombined &lt;- return |&gt; inner_join(pressure)\n\nfour &lt;- combined |&gt; filter(Player == \"Novak Djokovic\" | Player == \"Daniil Medvedev\" | Player == \"Jannik Sinner\" | Player == \"Carlos Alcaraz\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=combined, aes(x=`Under Pressure Rating`, y=`Return Rating`), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=four, aes(x=`Under Pressure Rating`, y=`Return Rating`), color=\"red\")+\n  geom_text_repel(data=four, aes(x=`Under Pressure Rating`, y=`Return Rating`, label=Player)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Under Pressure Rating\", \n    y=\"Return Rating\", \n    title=\"Does the time crunch alter return rates?\", \n    subtitle=\"Some seem to be more nervous than the others.\", \n    caption=\"Source: ATPTour.com | By Narmeena Ibrahimova\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nVisually, it’s apparent that all four of the men have pretty good return rates under pressure. But there are three significantly better at returning serves than Djokovic.\nBut is that enough?\nWinning tie breaks and winning deciding sets are ultimate points to win in tennis.\n\n\nCode\ntop20 &lt;- pressure |&gt; top_n(20, wt=`Under Pressure Rating`)\nfour &lt;- top20 |&gt; filter(Player == \"Novak Djokovic\" | Player == \"Daniil Medvedev\" | Player == \"Jannik Sinner\" | Player == \"Carlos Alcaraz\")\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=top20, \n    aes(y=Player, x=`Tie Breaks Won`, xend=`Deciding Sets Won`),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=four, \n    aes(y=Player, x=`Tie Breaks Won`, xend=`Deciding Sets Won`),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"black\",\n    colour_x = \"red\",\n    colour_xend = \"green\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Break Points and Tie Breaks\",\n    y=\"\",\n    title=\"The difference between winning tie breaks and deciciding sets\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;tie breaks won&lt;/span&gt; are on the right, that's good.

In fact, looking at their statistics, all of them are pretty close until you get to their serves.
